Trees

  Implement a BST with insert and delete functions

  Print a tree using BFS and DFS

  Write a function that determines if a tree is a BST

  Find the smallest element in a BST

  Find the 2nd largest number in a BST

  Given a binary tree which is a sum tree (child nodes add to parent), write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree

  Find the distance between 2 nodes in a BST and a normal binary tree

  Print the coordinates of every node in a binary tree, where root is 0,0

  Print a tree by levels

  Given a binary tree which is a sum tree, write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree

  Given a tree, verify that it contains a subtree.

  HARD: Find the max distance between 2 nodes in a BST.

  HARD: Construct a BST given the pre-order and in-order traversal Strings
