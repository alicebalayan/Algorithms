Stacks, Queues, and Heaps

  Implement a stack with push and pop functions

  Implement a queue with queue and dequeue functions

  Find the minimum element in a stack in O(1) time

  Write a function that sorts a stack (bonus: sort the stack in place without extra memory)

  Implement a binary min heap. Turn it into a binary max heap

  HARD: Implement a queue using 2 stacks
